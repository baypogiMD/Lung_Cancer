# Lung Cancer Risk Analysis using SQL and Python

## Overview
This repository presents an end-to-end analytical pipeline for exploring lung cancer risk factors using structured SQL analysis and machine learning workflows in Python.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle Lung Cancer Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer)  
Observations: ~300 individuals  
Features: Demographics, lifestyle indicators, symptoms  
Target: Lung cancer diagnosis (binary)

## Objectives
- Identify key lifestyle and symptom-based risk factors
- Quantify associations using SQL
- Build predictive models
- Deliver interpretable insights for public health and screening

## Tech Stack
- SQL (SQLite)
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Key Insights
- Smoking and symptom burden strongly correlate with lung cancer
- Combined risk scores outperform individual features
- Interpretable models support early screening frameworks
